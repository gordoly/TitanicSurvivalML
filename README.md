# Titanic Survival Prediction

## About

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using three machine learning models: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree. The dataset includes various passenger characteristics such as age, sex, class, and fare, among others. The models were trained on the dataset and evaluated based on accuracy and precision for both classes (survived vs. perished). The Decision Tree model achieved the highest overall accuracy of 81.36%, closely followed by the SVM model at 80.23%. Precision analysis showed that the SVM model was more effective at predicting passengers who perished, while the Decision Tree model excelled in predicting survivors. All three models demonstrated comparable performance, with slight differences in precision depending on the target class.
